**DESCRIPTION**: FIRSTLY I STARTED BY IMPORT JAVA, AS IT IS A PACKAGE TO STORE INFORMATION OR PREDEFINED MEANINGS OF FEW KEYWORDS. THEN I CREATED A CLASS OF AI(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE). THEN A METHOD OF STATIC VOID MAIN WAS GIVEN.AS WE KNOW THAT IN JAVA TO READ A FILE WE HAVE A CLASS NAMED AI(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE).SO WE CREATED AN OBJECT FROM A CLASS NAME AI(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE).I HAVE CREATED A DUMMY DATA SET WHICH IS HAVING A SCENARIO THAT INCLUDES THREE COLUMNS. THE FIRST COLUMN INCLUDES USER ID, SECOND COLUMN INCLUDES PRODUCT ID, AND THE THIRD ONE INCLUDES RATINGS THAT COMMENSE FROM ONE TO FIVE. WHERE FIVE IS THE HIGHEST RATING AND ONE IS THE LOWEST RATING. BASED UPON THE BEHAVIOUR OF TWO PERSONS WE CONSIDER THE SIMILARITIES OF TWO PERSONS. WE LOOK UPON THEIR PURCHASING BEHAVIOUR, ALSO TO THEIR EDITING BEHAVIOR. THE KIND OF RATINGS THEY HAVE GIVEN OR THE PRODUCTS THEY HAVE CHOOSEN. WE NEED TO CONFIGURATE THE SIMILARITY. THE REASON WHY SIMILARITY IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US IS BECAUSE WE CAN RECOMEND PRODUCT TO THE USER. LIKE IF YOU CLICK ON SOME OF THE APPS AND IF YOU RECEIVE ANY ADDS THEN THEY ARE PROVIDING SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE BACKGROUND. THEIR ARE SOME SIMILARITY FOMULAS, AND THEY ARE BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE CODE AS PER THE NEED.
